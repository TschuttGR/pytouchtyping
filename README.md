# pytouchtyping

The main idea of this project is to offer a tool to improve your typing speeds and accuracies on keyboards through effective touch typing.

## Description

We used to consider touch typing as useless, but after we started training, we realized that it is very effective! Unfortunately, however, we haven't found any tool that matches our needs that's why we are building our own.
Here we state the cornerstones of this application:

- open source
- desktop application (later also web)
- proposes only combinations that exist in a certain language
- puts forward combinations that the user often misses
- puts forward combinations in which the user takes a long time
- high modularity (keyboard layouts, languages, other ...)
- high customization

We started the project using python since it is simple and easy for everyone to tweak around. For the front end we are going to use PyQT6.

## Installation
